# X Spaces Hotkeys Bookmarklet

A powerful bookmarklet for X.com (Twitter) Spaces that lets you assign custom keyboard shortcuts to common actions like muting, leaving quietly, and sending emoji reactions — all without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.

Perfect for frequent Space participants, hosts, or anyone who wants faster control during live audio conversations.

   - Right-click the bookmarks bar → **Add page** / **New bookmark**
   - Name it something like **"Spaces Hotkeys"**
